1000 Seconds to AGI
Game Concept

"1000 Seconds to AGI" is a clicker-style incremental game where the player's goal is to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) within a 1000-second time limit. The game is set in a world where the ultimate objective is to create AGI to rule the world.
Core Mechanics

    Time Limit: Players have 1000 seconds to complete the game.
    Click Requirement: Players must click at least once every 10 seconds to keep the game active.
    Resource Generation: Clicking generates money, which is used to buy other resources.
    Progression: The game has 10 levels, each unveiling new game modes and challenges.

Resources

    Money: The primary resource, generated by clicking and used to purchase other resources.
    Energy: Purchased with money, used to power GPUs.
    GPUs: Purchased with money, used to create algorithms.
    Algorithms: Generated by GPUs, used to create LLMs.
    LLMs (Large Language Models): The final product, created from algorithms.
    Heat: Generated by GPUs (introduced at level 5).
    Coolers: Used to reduce heat (introduced at level 5).

Game Progression

    Level 1: Basic AI - Start of the journey
    Level 2: Automation - Unlock auto-clickers
    Level 3: Resource Management - Introduce generators for automatic energy production
    Level 4: Inventory System - Develop algorithms to create Language Models
    Level 5: Heat Management - Manage heat generated by GPUs and implement cooling systems
    Level 6: Advanced AI - Optimize GPU usage for faster algorithms
    Level 7: Machine Learning - Implement advanced machine learning techniques
    Level 8: Neural Networks - Create and train more sophisticated neural networks
    Level 9: Quantum Computing - Harness the power of quantum computing for AI
    Level 10: Artificial General Intelligence - Achieve the ultimate goal

Special Features

    Auto-clickers: Automatically generate money at regular intervals.
    Generators: Automatically produce energy at the cost of money.
    Heat Management: GPUs generate heat, which can halt production if it reaches 100%. Coolers help reduce heat.
    Inflation: Resource costs increase over time, adding an economic challenge.

Game Rules

    The game ends if the player doesn't click for 10 seconds or if the 1000-second timer runs out.
    Each level requires a certain amount of GPUs, energy, and LLMs to progress.
    GPUs consume energy to produce algorithms.
    Every 20 algorithms create a new LLM.
    At level 5, heat is introduced. If heat reaches 100%, GPU production stops until it's reduced.
    The game is won when the player reaches level 10 and achieves AGI.

User Interface Elements

    Progress Bar: Shows the remaining time out of 1000 seconds.
    Resource Display: Shows current amounts of money, energy, GPUs, algorithms, and LLMs.
    Heat Gauge: (From level 5) Displays current heat level.
    Buy Buttons: For purchasing energy, GPUs, auto-clickers, generators, and coolers.
    Level Display: Shows current level and requirements for the next level.

Strategies

    Balance resource allocation between different types (energy, GPUs, coolers).
    Manage heat levels to ensure continuous GPU operation.
    Invest in auto-clickers and generators for passive resource generation.
    Time level-ups strategically to take advantage of new features.

This game combines elements of resource management, strategic planning, and quick decision-making, all within a tight time constraint, creating an engaging and challenging experience for players aiming to develop AGI.
